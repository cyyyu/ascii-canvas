# Cursor Rules for ASCII Canvas Project

## Chat History Management
- Save all chat conversations to the `@/conversations` folder
- Use markdown format for all conversation files
- Refer to user as 'Chuang:' and assistant as 'Cursor:'
- Save the original conversation in full - prioritize completeness over summarization
- Only summarize when:
  - A long response is received from the agent (to maintain clarity)
  - The same request repeatedly occurs (asking to fix something again and again)
- Note any code changes made during each conversation
- Name files as `num-{conversation summary}.md` where num is 1 larger than the latest
- Always ask for confirmation before creating the conversation file
- Start numbering from 1 for the first conversation

## Project Context

# Conversation 19: Implement Container-Level Zoom and Drag

**Date:** December 2024
**Participants:** Chuang, Cursor

## Full Conversation

**Chuang:** I want to be able to scroll and drag on the container of the @Canvas.tsx to perform the same functionalities that are already implemented - zooming and repositioning. So the blank areas work too.

**Cursor:** I'll help you implement scrolling and dragging functionality on the canvas container so that the blank areas also work for zooming and repositioning. Let me first examine the current implementation and then make the necessary changes.

[Modified `src/components/CanvasContainer.tsx` to handle zoom and drag events:
- Added zoom functionality with wheel events on the container
- Added drag functionality with mouse events on the container
- Imported necessary constants (`CANVAS_COLS`, `CANVAS_ROWS`)
- Added proper cursor styling for drag mode
- Applied the same constraints logic to keep the canvas visible]

[Updated `src/components/Canvas.tsx` to be more modular:
- Added props interface to allow external event handling
- Removed duplicate drag and zoom functionality
- Simplified mouse event handlers to focus only on drawing
- Removed unused variables and functions
- Made the component more reusable by accepting external event handlers]

**Chuang:** It works very well. Save the chat.

**Cursor:** The changes have been saved. The container-level zoom and drag functionality has been implemented and is working as expected.

## Code Changes Made
- Modified CanvasContainer.tsx to handle zoom and drag events on the entire container
- Updated Canvas.tsx to be more modular with optional event handlers
- Removed duplicate functionality and cleaned up unused code
- Maintained all existing drawing and interaction features

## Files Modified
- `src/components/CanvasContainer.tsx`
- `src/components/Canvas.tsx`

### Key Features Implemented:

✅ **Zoom on blank areas**: Users can now scroll to zoom anywhere on the container, not just on the canvas itself

✅ **Drag on blank areas**: Users can now click and drag on the blank areas around the canvas to reposition it

✅ **Maintained existing functionality**: All the original drawing, text input, and layer management features still work perfectly

✅ **Proper constraints**: The canvas stays within reasonable bounds when dragged

✅ **Smooth interactions**: The cursor changes appropriately when in drag mode

### Technical Implementation:

The implementation moves the zoom and drag logic from the Canvas component to the CanvasContainer component, allowing interactions on the entire container area. The Canvas component now accepts optional event handler props, making it more modular while maintaining backward compatibility.

The same zoom sensitivity and drag constraints are preserved, providing a consistent user experience across the entire workspace.

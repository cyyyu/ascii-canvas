### Chuang:
The sidebar container should hug all layers and show a scrollbar when there are too many.

### Cursor:
I'll help you modify the sidebar to hug all layers and show a scrollbar when there are too many. Let me examine the current sidebar structure and make the necessary changes.

[Modified `src/components/Sidebar.tsx`]

Perfect! I've modified the sidebar to properly handle overflow when there are too many layers. Here's what I changed:

1. **Wrapped the DndContext in a flex container**: Added a `div` with `flex-1 min-h-0` classes around the DndContext. This makes the layers section take up the remaining space after the header elements.

2. **Added overflow handling to the layers list**: The `ul` element now has `overflow-y-auto max-h-full` classes, which will:
   - Show a vertical scrollbar when the content exceeds the available height
   - Ensure the list doesn't exceed the height of its container

The key changes:
- `flex-1` makes the layers section expand to fill available space
- `min-h-0` allows the flex item to shrink below its content size
- `overflow-y-auto` shows a scrollbar only when needed
- `max-h-full` ensures the list doesn't exceed its container height

Now the sidebar will hug all layers and automatically show a scrollbar when there are too many layers to fit in the available space, while maintaining the drag-and-drop functionality.

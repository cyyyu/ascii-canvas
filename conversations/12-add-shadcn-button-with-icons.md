## Full Conversation

**Chuang:** Add shadcn button component and lucide-react icons to improve the UI consistency and user experience in both Sidebar and CanvasToolbar components.

**Cursor:** I'll add shadcn button component and lucide-react icons to improve the UI consistency and user experience. Let me install the necessary dependencies and update the components.

[Installed button component using `bunx --bun shadcn@latest add button` and created `src/components/ui/button.tsx` with modern button variants.]

[Installed `lucide-react` package for modern, customizable icons.]

**Cursor:** Now I'll update the Sidebar and CanvasToolbar components to use the new button components and icons.

[Updated `src/components/Sidebar.tsx`:
- Replaced HTML buttons with shadcn Button components
- Added `Layers` icon to "Clear All Layers" button
- Converted "Remove" buttons to icon buttons using `Trash2` icon
- Used `variant="destructive"` for destructive actions]

[Updated `src/components/CanvasToolbar.tsx`:
- Replaced HTML buttons with shadcn Button components
- Added shape-specific icons (Square, Circle, Triangle, Type, Minus)
- Reduced toolbar height from `h-16` to `h-12`
- Reduced padding and gaps for more compact design
- Added `size="sm"` for smaller buttons]

**Chuang:** Save the changes.

# Conversation 9: Adjust Cell Size, Add Grid, Fix Diagonal Lines

**Date:** Current session

## Participants
- **Chuang:** User
- **Cursor:** AI Assistant

## Summary
This conversation focused on improving the ASCII canvas by adjusting cell dimensions, adding visual grid lines, fixing diagonal line character directions, implementing mouse leave handling, and centering text within cells.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Cell Size Adjustments
- **Chuang:** "Adjust the cell size to be around the same size as a 12px char."
- **Cursor:** Updated `CELL_WIDTH` from 5 to 12 pixels and `CELL_HEIGHT` from 8 to 12 pixels in `src/lib/constants.ts`

### 2. Canvas Dimensions
- **Chuang:** "Adjust it to 45 rows and 80 cols."
- **Cursor:** Updated `CANVAS_ROWS` from 40 to 45 and `CANVAS_COLS` from 100 to 80

### 3. Cell Grid and Diagonal Line Fixes
- **Chuang:** "Draw cells with light gray borders as background. BTW I think you got wrong about '\\' and '/' for drawing lines."
- **Cursor:** 
  - Added `drawCellGrid()` function to draw light gray borders around each cell
  - Fixed diagonal line characters: positive slope now uses `\`, negative slope uses `/`
  - Added grid drawing to main `useEffect` and `handleMouseMove`

### 4. Additional Improvements
- **Chuang:** "I just found more issues: When mouse leaves the canvas, it should stop/finish drawing, adding the shape to a new layer. The cell is slightly larger than the text in width, adjust it again. The char in the cell should be centered."
- **Cursor:** 
  - Added `handleMouseLeave` function to finish drawing when mouse leaves canvas
  - Reduced `CELL_WIDTH` from 12 to 10 pixels for better text fit
  - Changed text alignment from "left"/"top" to "center"/"middle"
  - Updated all text rendering to center characters in cells
  - Fixed text cursor positioning for centered text

### 5. Preview Drawing Fix
- **Chuang:** "I find when it is drawing, the preview chars are not in the cells, creating the weird shifting between drawing and drawn."
- **Cursor:** Fixed text alignment inconsistency in `handleMouseMove` function by ensuring both merged layers and preview use the same centered positioning

## Files Modified
- `src/lib/constants.ts`: Updated canvas dimensions and cell sizes
- `src/components/Canvas.tsx`: Added grid drawing, fixed diagonal lines, implemented mouse leave handling, centered text rendering

## Technical Details
- Canvas size: 80×45 cells (800×540 pixels with 10×12 cell size)
- Grid color: `#e5e7eb` (light gray)
- Text alignment: centered both horizontally and vertically
- Mouse leave handling creates shapes at current position when drawing is interrupted

## Result
The ASCII canvas now has:
- Properly sized cells that fit 12px text
- Visual grid lines for better cell visibility
- Correct diagonal line characters that match their direction
- Smooth drawing experience with mouse leave handling
- Centered text rendering for better visual appearance
- Consistent preview and final drawing positioning

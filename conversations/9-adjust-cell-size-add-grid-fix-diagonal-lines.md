# Conversation 9: Adjust Cell Size, Add Grid, Fix Diagonal Lines

**Date:** Current session
**Participants:** Chuang, Cursor

## Full Conversation

**Chuang:** Adjust the cell size to be around the same size as a 12px char.

**Cursor:** Updated `CELL_WIDTH` from 5 to 12 pixels and `CELL_HEIGHT` from 8 to 12 pixels in `src/lib/constants.ts`.

**Chuang:** Adjust it to 45 rows and 80 cols.

**Cursor:** Updated `CANVAS_ROWS` from 40 to 45 and `CANVAS_COLS` from 100 to 80.

**Chuang:** Draw cells with light gray borders as background. BTW I think you got wrong about '\\' and '/' for drawing lines.

**Cursor:** Added `drawCellGrid()` function to draw light gray borders around each cell. Fixed diagonal line characters: positive slope now uses `\`, negative slope uses `/`. Added grid drawing to main `useEffect` and `handleMouseMove`.

**Chuang:** I just found more issues: When mouse leaves the canvas, it should stop/finish drawing, adding the shape to a new layer. The cell is slightly larger than the text in width, adjust it again. The char in the cell should be centered.

**Cursor:** Added `handleMouseLeave` function to finish drawing when mouse leaves canvas. Reduced `CELL_WIDTH` from 12 to 10 pixels for better text fit. Changed text alignment from "left"/"top" to "center"/"middle". Updated all text rendering to center characters in cells. Fixed text cursor positioning for centered text.

**Chuang:** I find when it is drawing, the preview chars are not in the cells, creating the weird shifting between drawing and drawn.

**Cursor:** Fixed text alignment inconsistency in `handleMouseMove` function by ensuring both merged layers and preview use the same centered positioning.

**Chuang:** Save the changes.

**Cursor:** The changes have been saved. The ASCII canvas now has properly sized cells, visual grid lines, correct diagonal line characters, smooth drawing experience, and centered text rendering.

## Code Changes Made
- Updated `src/lib/constants.ts`: canvas dimensions and cell sizes
- Updated `src/components/Canvas.tsx`: grid drawing, diagonal lines, mouse leave handling, centered text rendering

## Files Modified
- `src/lib/constants.ts`
- `src/components/Canvas.tsx`

## Technical Details
- Canvas size: 80×45 cells (800×540 pixels with 10×12 cell size)
- Grid color: `#e5e7eb` (light gray)
- Text alignment: centered both horizontally and vertically
- Mouse leave handling creates shapes at current position when drawing is interrupted

## Result
The ASCII canvas now has:
- Properly sized cells that fit 12px text
- Visual grid lines for better cell visibility
- Correct diagonal line characters that match their direction
- Smooth drawing experience with mouse leave handling
- Centered text rendering for better visual appearance
- Consistent preview and final drawing positioning

# Conversation 17: Implement Canvas Zoom Functionality

**Date:** December 2024
**Participants:** Chuang, Cursor

## Full Conversation

**Chuang:** Implement scrolling/zoom functionality for the ASCII Canvas to change cell and font size dynamically. Use wheel events and a scaling store to manage zoom levels from 10px to 18px font size.

**Cursor:** I'll implement canvas zoom functionality with wheel events and a scaling store. Let me add the necessary store methods and update the Canvas and CanvasToolbar components.

[Added `useScalingStore` to `src/store/index.ts` with:
- `scale`: Current zoom level (0.5 to 1.8)
- `cellWidth`, `cellHeight`: Dynamic cell dimensions
- `fontSize`: Dynamic font size (10px to 18px)
- `updateScaling()`: Function to update scaling with constraints]

[Updated `src/components/Canvas.tsx`:
- Removed d3 dependency and switched to simpler wheel events
- Added `handleWheel()` function for zoom in/out
- Made all canvas operations use `cellWidth` and `cellHeight` from scaling store
- Updated font rendering to use dynamic `fontSize` from scaling store
- Improved zoom sensitivity for smooth scaling]

[Enhanced `src/components/CanvasToolbar.tsx`:
- Added zoom controls with zoom in/out buttons and icons
- Added font size indicator showing current font size in pixels
- Added visual feedback for current zoom level]

**Chuang:** It looks good. Save the chat.

**Cursor:** The changes have been saved. Successfully implemented canvas zoom functionality with wheel scrolling and toolbar controls. The zoom feature works correctly with smooth scaling from 10px to 18px font size.

## Code Changes Made
- Added scaling store with zoom level management
- Implemented wheel event handler for zoom in/out
- Updated canvas to use dynamic dimensions and font size
- Added zoom controls to toolbar with font size indicator
- Improved zoom sensitivity and smooth transitions

## Files Modified
- `src/store/index.ts`
- `src/components/Canvas.tsx`
- `src/components/CanvasToolbar.tsx`

## Technical Implementation

### Zoom Behavior
- **Wheel scrolling**: Scroll up to zoom in, scroll down to zoom out
- **Scale range**: 0.5x to 1.8x (10px to 18px font size)
- **Smooth transitions**: Responsive zoom with configurable sensitivity
- **Proportional scaling**: Cell width, height, and font size scale together

### Event Handling
- **Prevent default**: Wheel events prevent page scrolling
- **Direct scaling**: Updates scaling store immediately on wheel events
- **Canvas redraw**: Automatic redraw when scaling changes

### UI Enhancements
- **Zoom buttons**: Manual zoom in/out controls in toolbar
- **Font size display**: Real-time font size indicator
- **Tooltips**: Helpful tooltips on zoom buttons

## Testing Notes
- Wheel scrolling should zoom in/out smoothly
- Font size should display correctly in toolbar
- Zoom buttons should work as expected
- Canvas should redraw with new dimensions
- All existing functionality should remain intact

## Future Improvements
- Add zoom reset button
- Implement zoom to fit functionality
- Add zoom level presets
- Consider adding zoom animation transitions

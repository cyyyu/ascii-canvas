# Conversation 18: Fix Passive Event Listener Errors

**Date:** December 2024  
**Participants:** Chuang, Cursor

## Summary
Fixed console errors related to passive event listeners in the Canvas component's wheel event handling for zoom functionality. The issue was that React's onWheel prop creates passive event listeners by default, which prevent preventDefault() from being called.

## Problem Identified
**Chuang:** "On previous change (find it in the @/conversations folder), I see lots of errors in the console. Can you fix it? `Canvas.tsx:76 Unable to preventDefault inside passive event listener invocation.`"

## Root Cause
The wheel event handler was using React's `onWheel` prop, which creates passive event listeners by default in modern browsers. Passive event listeners cannot call `preventDefault()`, causing the console error when trying to prevent default scrolling behavior during zoom operations.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Changed Event Handler Signature
- **Before**: `handleWheel = (e: React.WheelEvent<HTMLCanvasElement>)`
- **After**: `handleWheel = (e: WheelEvent)`
- **Reason**: Native DOM events work better with manual event listeners

### 2. Replaced React onWheel with Manual Event Listener
- **Removed**: `onWheel={handleWheel}` prop from canvas element
- **Added**: useEffect hook with manual event listener setup
- **Key**: Used `{ passive: false }` option to allow preventDefault()

### 3. Added Proper Event Listener Management
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const canvas = canvasRef.current;
  if (!canvas) return;

  const wheelHandler = (e: WheelEvent) => handleWheel(e);
  
  // Add event listener with non-passive option
  canvas.addEventListener('wheel', wheelHandler, { passive: false });
  
  return () => {
    canvas.removeEventListener('wheel', wheelHandler);
  };
}, [updateScaling]);
```

## Code Changes Made

### Canvas.tsx Updates
- Modified `handleWheel` function to accept native `WheelEvent`
- Added useEffect hook for manual wheel event listener setup
- Removed `onWheel` prop from canvas element
- Added proper cleanup in useEffect return function

## Technical Details

### Why This Fix Works
1. **Non-passive listeners**: `{ passive: false }` allows preventDefault() calls
2. **Native DOM events**: Direct access to wheel event properties
3. **Proper cleanup**: Prevents memory leaks by removing listeners on unmount
4. **Dependency management**: useEffect depends on updateScaling function

### Browser Compatibility
- **Modern browsers**: All support non-passive event listeners
- **React compatibility**: Works with React's event system
- **Performance**: No impact on zoom functionality performance

## Testing Results
- ✅ Console errors eliminated
- ✅ Zoom functionality works correctly
- ✅ Wheel events properly prevent default scrolling
- ✅ No memory leaks from event listeners
- ✅ All existing canvas functionality preserved

## Resolution
**Chuang:** "Perfect. Save the chat."
**Cursor:** Successfully fixed the passive event listener console errors by implementing manual wheel event listeners with non-passive options, ensuring proper preventDefault() functionality for zoom operations.

## Key Takeaways
- React's onWheel prop creates passive event listeners by default
- Manual event listeners with `{ passive: false }` are needed for preventDefault()
- Proper cleanup is essential when using manual event listeners
- Native DOM events provide better control for complex interactions

## Future Considerations
- Monitor for similar issues with other event handlers
- Consider creating a custom hook for wheel event handling
- Document this pattern for future reference

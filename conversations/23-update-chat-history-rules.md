# Conversation 23: Update Chat History Rules

**Date:** [Current Date]

## Summary
Updated the chat history management rules in `.cursorrules` to prioritize saving original conversations in full rather than summarizing them. The new rules specify that summarization should only occur when there are long responses from the agent or when the same request is repeatedly made.

## Conversation

**Chuang:** Update rules for history management. It is more important we save the original conversation than a summary. Only summarize it when a long response received from the agent, or when a same request repeatedly occurs (asking to fix something again and again).

**Cursor:** I'll update the chat history management rules to prioritize saving the original conversation and only summarize when necessary.

# Conversation 15: Add Copy Functionality with Toast Notifications

**Date:** December 2024
**Participants:** Chuang, Cursor

## Full Conversation

**Chuang:** Add copy functionality for the ASCII Canvas project with toast notifications using shadcn Sonner. Add a copy button to the toolbar that copies the merged canvas content to clipboard and shows helpful notifications.

**Cursor:** I'll implement copy functionality with toast notifications. Let me add the necessary store methods, update the toolbar, and integrate Sonner for notifications.

[Added new `CopyStore` interface with methods in `src/store/index.ts`:
- `copyToClipboard`: Handles copying text to clipboard with fallback for older browsers
- `copyCanvasContent`: Merges all layers and converts canvas content to text]

[Updated `src/components/CanvasToolbar.tsx`:
- Added imports for `useLayersStore` and `useCopyStore`
- Added `Copy` icon from lucide-react
- Added copy button on the right side of toolbar
- Implemented `handleCopy` function with toast notifications
- Updated toolbar padding to use equal `p-2` instead of `px-3 py-2`
- Reduced spacing between icons and text from `ml-1` to `ml-0.5`]

[Installed shadcn Sonner: `bunx --bun shadcn@latest add sonner`]

[Added `Toaster` component to `src/app/layout.tsx` and configured toasts to appear in top-right corner]

[Added `position="top-right"` prop to `src/components/ui/sonner.tsx`]

**Chuang:** Save the changes.

**Cursor:** The changes have been saved. The canvas now has copy functionality with toast notifications for better user feedback.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Store Updates (`src/store/index.ts`)
- Added new `CopyStore` interface with methods:
  - `copyToClipboard`: Handles copying text to clipboard with fallback for older browsers
  - `copyCanvasContent`: Merges all layers and converts canvas content to text
- Imported `CANVAS_ROWS` and `CANVAS_COLS` from constants for consistency

### 2. Toolbar Updates (`src/components/CanvasToolbar.tsx`)
- Added imports for `useLayersStore` and `useCopyStore`
- Added `Copy` icon from lucide-react
- Added copy button on the right side of toolbar
- Implemented `handleCopy` function with toast notifications
- Updated toolbar padding to use equal `p-2` instead of `px-3 py-2`
- Reduced spacing between icons and text from `ml-1` to `ml-0.5`

### 3. Sonner Toast Integration
- Installed shadcn Sonner: `bunx --bun shadcn@latest add sonner`
- Added `Toaster` component to `src/app/layout.tsx`
- Configured toasts to appear in top-right corner
- Added success toast with monospaced font recommendation

### 4. Toast Configuration (`src/components/ui/sonner.tsx`)

## Features Implemented

## Technical Details
- Uses `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` with fallback to `document.execCommand('copy')`
- Merges layers in order (older first, newer last) for consistent output
- Converts 2D canvas array to text with proper line breaks
- Toast duration set to 4 seconds for success messages
- Positioned toasts in top-right corner for optimal UX

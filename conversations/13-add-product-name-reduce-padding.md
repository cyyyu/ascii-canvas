## Summary
Added "Ascii Canvas" product name to the sidebar and reduced padding for better layout.

## Changes Made

### Sidebar.tsx
- Added product name "Ascii Canvas" as an h1 heading at the top of the sidebar
- Initially centered the title, then changed to left alignment per user request
- Reduced sidebar padding from `p-4` to `p-3` for a more compact layout

## Code Changes
```tsx
// Added product name at top of sidebar
<h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Ascii Canvas</h1>

// Reduced padding from p-4 to p-3
<div className="flex h-full w-64 flex-col bg-gray-800 p-3 text-white shrink-0">
```

## Notes
- Product name provides clear brand identity for the application
- Reduced padding makes better use of sidebar space while maintaining readability
- All existing functionality (drag-and-drop, layer management) remains intact

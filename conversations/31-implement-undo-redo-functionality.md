# Conversation 31: Implement Undo/Redo Functionality

**Date**: December 19, 2024  
**Participants**: Chuang, Cursor

## Full Conversation

**Chuang**: Undo/Redo support. Implement undo/redo for layer manipulations, including adding/deleteing/reordering and deleting all layers operations. Here is a rough design:
* We save at most 5 history of the editions.
* Add 2 buttons to the toolbar for undo/redo.
* We also let user know how many editions can be undo/redo ed. For example, there are numbers next to the button. When user keeps editing, he sees the number in 'undo' grows to 5 at most. When he clicks undo, he sees it decreases by 1 each time, and the number in 'redo' grows by 1. When he starts editing again, the number in 'undo' grows, and the number in 'redo' resets.

**Cursor**: I'll implement undo/redo functionality for layer manipulations. Let me first examine the current store structure to understand how layers are managed.

[Examined the store structure and implemented the following changes:]

1. **Added UndoRedoStore**: Created a new store to manage undo/redo history with a maximum of 6 entries
2. **Modified LayersStore**: Updated all layer manipulation methods to save state to history
3. **Updated CanvasToolbar**: Added undo/redo buttons with counts and keyboard shortcuts
4. **Enhanced Canvas Component**: Added initialization for undo/redo history

**Chuang**: I found 3 issues:
* The size of the undo/redo buttons should be consistant. Let's fix this by adding a `0` when there is no histories.
* When I click on it 1 time, the tooltip says 'reverted 4 changes', which should be 1.
* I never see it grows to 5.

**Cursor**: I'll fix these three issues:

1. **Button size consistency**: Always show the count (including 0) to maintain consistent button sizes
2. **Wrong toast message**: Fixed to show "Reverted 1 change" instead of using the count variable
3. **History not growing to 5**: Added initialization flag and debugging to track the issue

**Chuang**: There are still some minor issues:
* The number still doesn't grow to 5.
* The Text shape shouldn't be treated as 1 char 1 change. Instead, the whole text layer is 1 change.

**Cursor**: I'll fix these two issues:

1. **History not growing to 5**: The problem was that each character input was creating a new history entry
2. **Text shape treating each character as a change**: Need to batch text changes and only save state when complete

**Chuang**: The `5` issue is still there. I think you might interpret it wrongly. `5` here is that we show at most `5` on the undo/redo button, meaning we can revert it 5 times. That means we have 6 including current session.

**Cursor**: Ah, I understand now! The issue is with my interpretation of the history management. You want to show at most `5` on the undo button, which means we can undo 5 times, so we need 6 total states (including the current state). Let me fix this:

**Fixed**: Changed `maxHistory` from 5 to 6 to allow 6 total states (including current) for 5 undos

## Code Changes Made

### Store Updates (`src/store/index.ts`)
- Added `UndoRedoStore` interface with history management
- Implemented `saveState`, `undo`, `redo`, and `clearHistory` methods
- Modified all `LayersStore` methods to automatically save state after operations
- Added `setLayers` method for direct layer state updates
- **Fixed**: Added `updateLayerWithoutSaving` method for text input that needs immediate visual updates without creating history entries
- **Fixed**: Changed `maxHistory` from 5 to 6 to allow 6 total states (including current) for 5 undos
- Removed debugging console logs

### Toolbar Updates (`src/components/CanvasToolbar.tsx`)
- Added undo/redo buttons with visual count indicators
- **Fixed**: Always show count (including 0) for consistent button sizes
- **Fixed**: Toast messages now show "Reverted 1 change" instead of wrong count
- Implemented keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y, Ctrl+Shift+Z)
- Added toast notifications for undo/redo operations
- Integrated with undo/redo store for state management

### Canvas Updates (`src/components/Canvas.tsx`)
- Added initialization effect to set up initial empty state in history
- **Fixed**: Added initialization flag to prevent multiple initializations
- **Fixed**: Added debounced text input handling to batch character changes
- **Fixed**: Added `updateLayerWithoutSaving` for immediate text visual updates
- **Fixed**: Added timeout cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Imported undo/redo store for state management

## Technical Challenges Solved

1. **Deep Cloning**: Implemented proper deep cloning of layer data to avoid reference issues
2. **History Management**: Created efficient history management with maximum 6 entries (allowing 5 undos)
3. **State Synchronization**: Ensured all layer operations automatically save to history
4. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Added comprehensive keyboard support while avoiding conflicts with text input
5. **Visual Feedback**: Implemented count indicators and toast notifications for user feedback
6. **Button Consistency**: Fixed button sizing by always showing count indicators
7. **Toast Accuracy**: Fixed toast messages to show correct change count
8. **Initialization Issues**: Prevented multiple initializations that could interfere with history
9. **Text Input Batching**: Implemented debounced text input to treat entire text layer as one change
10. **Memory Management**: Added proper cleanup for timeouts to prevent memory leaks
11. **History Capacity**: Fixed maxHistory to allow 6 total states for 5 undo operations

## Features Implemented

- [x] Undo/Redo store with maximum 6 history entries (allowing 5 undos)
- [x] Automatic state saving for all layer operations (add, remove, reorder, clear)
- [x] Undo/Redo buttons with count indicators (always visible for consistency)
- [x] Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y, Ctrl+Shift+Z)
- [x] Toast notifications for undo/redo operations (showing correct count)
- [x] Proper state initialization with flag to prevent multiple initializations
- [x] Deep cloning to prevent reference issues
- [x] History truncation when maximum is reached
- [x] **Fixed**: Text input batching with 500ms debounce to treat text layer as one change
- [x] **Fixed**: Immediate visual updates for text input without creating history entries
- [x] **Fixed**: Proper timeout cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- [x] **Fixed**: Correct history capacity to show up to 5 on undo button

## Issues Fixed

1. **Button Size Consistency**: Always show count (including 0) instead of conditionally showing
2. **Wrong Toast Message**: Fixed to show "Reverted 1 change" instead of using `undoCount` variable
3. **History Growth**: Added initialization flag and debugging to track why history might not reach 5
4. **Text Input Batching**: Implemented debounced text input to treat entire text layer as one change instead of per-character
5. **Memory Leaks**: Added proper cleanup for text input timeouts
6. **History Capacity**: Fixed maxHistory from 5 to 6 to allow 6 total states for 5 undo operations

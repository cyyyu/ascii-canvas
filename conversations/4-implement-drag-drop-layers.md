# Conversation 4: Implement Drag/Drop for Layers

**Date**: Current session

## Summary
Implemented drag and drop functionality for layers in the sidebar using dnd-kit library. Users can now reorder layers by dragging them up and down, with visual feedback and keyboard accessibility support.

## Chuang:
Support drag/drop of layers. Use dnd-kit for UX. Use the methods defined in @/store to reorder them.

## Cursor:
I'll help you implement drag and drop functionality for layers using dnd-kit. First, let me examine the store to understand the available methods for reordering layers.

[Examined store/index.ts and found reorderLayers method]

Perfect! I can see that the store already has a `reorderLayers` method that takes `fromIndex` and `toIndex` parameters. Now I need to install dnd-kit and implement the drag and drop functionality in the Sidebar component.

## Chuang:
Use bun to manage libs. (add this to @.cursorrules too)

## Cursor:
I'll use bun to install the dnd-kit libraries and also update the .cursorrules file to include the bun preference.

[Installed @dnd-kit/core, @dnd-kit/sortable, @dnd-kit/utilities using bun]

[Updated .cursorrules to include bun preference]

Now I'll implement the drag and drop functionality in the Sidebar component using dnd-kit:

[Implemented complete drag and drop functionality with:
- DndContext and SortableContext wrappers
- Custom SortableLayerItem component
- Drag sensors for pointer and keyboard
- Visual feedback during drag operations
- Integration with store's reorderLayers method]

Perfect! I've successfully implemented drag and drop functionality for the layers using dnd-kit. Here's what I've added:

## Key Features Implemented:

1. **Drag and Drop Support**: Layers can now be reordered by dragging them up and down in the sidebar
2. **Visual Feedback**: 
   - Layers become semi-transparent (50% opacity) while being dragged
   - Hover effects on layer items
   - Smooth transitions during drag operations
3. **Accessibility**: Keyboard support for drag and drop operations
4. **Integration with Store**: Uses the existing `reorderLayers` method from the store to persist changes

## Technical Implementation:

- **DndContext**: Wraps the sortable list and handles drag events
- **SortableContext**: Manages the sortable items and their strategy
- **SortableLayerItem**: A custom component that wraps each layer with drag functionality
- **Sensors**: Configured for both pointer (mouse/touch) and keyboard interactions
- **Event Handling**: The `handleDragEnd` function calculates the old and new indices and calls the store's `reorderLayers` method

The implementation maintains all existing functionality (add, remove, clear all layers) while adding the new drag and drop capability. The UI has been enhanced with better styling for the draggable items, including a move cursor and hover effects.

## Chuang:
Yes save it.

## Code Changes Made:
1. **Installed dependencies**: Added @dnd-kit/core, @dnd-kit/sortable, @dnd-kit/utilities using bun
2. **Updated .cursorrules**: Added note about using bun for package management
3. **Enhanced Sidebar.tsx**: 
   - Added dnd-kit imports and components
   - Created SortableLayerItem component for drag functionality
   - Implemented DndContext and SortableContext wrappers
   - Added drag sensors and event handlers
   - Enhanced UI with better styling and visual feedback
   - Integrated with store's reorderLayers method
   - Fixed linter error by removing unused arrayMove import

## Files Modified:
- `.cursorrules` - Added bun package management preference
- `src/components/Sidebar.tsx` - Complete drag and drop implementation
- `package.json` - Added dnd-kit dependencies (via bun)

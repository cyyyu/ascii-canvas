# Conversation 4: Implement Drag/Drop for Layers

**Date:** Current session
**Participants:** Chuang, Cursor

## Full Conversation

**Chuang:** Support drag/drop of layers. Use dnd-kit for UX. Use the methods defined in @/store to reorder them.

**Cursor:** I'll help you implement drag and drop functionality for layers using dnd-kit. First, let me examine the store to understand the available methods for reordering layers.

[Examined store/index.ts and found reorderLayers method.]

**Cursor:** Perfect! I can see that the store already has a `reorderLayers` method that takes `fromIndex` and `toIndex` parameters. Now I need to install dnd-kit and implement the drag and drop functionality in the Sidebar component.

**Chuang:** Use bun to manage libs. (add this to @.cursorrules too)

**Cursor:** I'll use bun to install the dnd-kit libraries and also update the .cursorrules file to include the bun preference.

[Installed @dnd-kit/core, @dnd-kit/sortable, @dnd-kit/utilities using bun.]
[Updated .cursorrules to include bun preference.]

**Cursor:** Now I'll implement the drag and drop functionality in the Sidebar component using dnd-kit:

[Implemented complete drag and drop functionality with:
- DndContext and SortableContext wrappers
- Custom SortableLayerItem component
- Drag sensors for pointer and keyboard
- Visual feedback during drag operations
- Integration with store's reorderLayers method]

**Cursor:** Perfect! I've successfully implemented drag and drop functionality for the layers using dnd-kit. Here's what I've added:

## Code Changes Made
1. **Installed dependencies**: Added @dnd-kit/core, @dnd-kit/sortable, @dnd-kit/utilities using bun
2. **Updated .cursorrules**: Added note about using bun for package management
3. **Enhanced Sidebar.tsx**: 
   - Added dnd-kit imports and components
   - Created SortableLayerItem component for drag functionality
   - Implemented DndContext and SortableContext wrappers
   - Added drag sensors and event handlers
   - Enhanced UI with better styling and visual feedback
   - Integrated with store's reorderLayers method
   - Fixed linter error by removing unused arrayMove import

**Chuang:** Yes save it.

**Cursor:** The changes have been saved. The sidebar now supports drag and drop for layers, with full visual feedback and accessibility.

## Files Modified
- `.cursorrules` - Added bun package management preference
- `src/components/Sidebar.tsx` - Complete drag and drop implementation
- `package.json` - Added dnd-kit dependencies (via bun)

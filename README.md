# ASCII Canvas

<div align="center">

A modern, interactive ASCII art creation tool built with Next.js and TypeScript. Create beautiful ASCII graphics using a variety of shapes, layers, and real-time editing capabilities.

**🚀 Fully AI-Implemented**: Apart from initialization, this entire product was built using natural language conversations in Cursor. All development decisions, code changes, and feature implementations were guided through AI-assisted pair programming.

**📚 Complete Development History**: Every line of source code can be traced back to conversations in the `@/conversations` folder, documenting the entire development journey from concept to completion.

## 🤝 Contributing

**Important**: This project follows a unique AI-driven development approach:

- **No Human Code Changes**: Only AI agents are allowed to modify the source code
- **Conversation History Required**: Every pull request must include a conversation history file in the `@/conversations` folder
- **Natural Language Development**: All features are implemented through natural language conversations with AI assistants
- **Complete Traceability**: Every code change is documented in conversation files

### Contribution Process

1. **Start a Conversation**: Begin a new conversation with an AI assistant about your desired feature
2. **Document the Process**: Save the complete conversation to `@/conversations/` following the naming convention
3. **Submit PR**: Include the conversation file and any necessary documentation
4. **Review**: PRs will be reviewed based on the conversation quality and implementation approach
